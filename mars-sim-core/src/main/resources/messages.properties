# The English language version is the default that translations use when incomplete.
# Tooltips are allowed to contain HTML markup elements, at least in theory.
# Because the usual user will probably never get to see them, the
# following categories have low translation priority: log, thread and img.
# Until the unit names and descriptions defined in the config XML files
# become translatable too, it is probably too soon to recruit translators.
