	growing-time : # of sols
	crop-category : crop type
	edible-biomass : gram per m^2 per day
	edible-water-content : in proportion of 1 (1 is 100%)
	inedible-biomass : gram per m^2 per day
	daily-PAR : in mol per  m^2 per day

	Note: 1 metric ton = 1 tonnes

	1 tonnes per hectare = 0.1 kg per m^2
	1/100 tonnes per hectare per day = 1 gram per m^2 per day

8.  Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is light with a wavelength between 300/400 nm and 700 nm

	Researchers measure instantaneous light in micro-moles (μmol) per square
	meter (m-2) per second (s-1), or: μmol·m-2·s-1 of PAR. This “quantum” unit quantifies the number of
	photons (individual particles of energy) used in photosynthesis that fall on a square meter (10.8
	square feet) every second.

	This light measurement is an instantaneous reading.

	Daily light integral (DLI) or Daily PAR is the amount of PAR received
	each day as a function of light intensity (instantaneous light: μmol·m-2·s-1) and duration (day). It is expressed
	as moles of light (mol) per square meter (m-2) per day (d-1), or: mol·m-2·d-1 (moles per day).
	The DLI concept is like a rain gauge. Just as a rain gauge collects the total rain in a particular location over
	a period of time, so DLI measures the total amount of PAR received in a day. Greenhouse growers can use
	light meters to measure the number of light photons that accumulate in a square meter over a 24-hour period.

10.	Total water use and water requirement:
	soybean: total: 845 kg, req :  414 kg per gram....

11. MPR Model: a crop model that consists of a set of nonlinear polynomial equations, six for each crop,
	developed using multivariate polynomial regression (MPR).

	The dependent variables for three of the six MPR equations are the relative growth rates
	of (a) total dry mass prior to formation of yield bearing organs, (b) total dry mass after the
	formation of yield bearing organs, and (c) yield dry mass.

	The independent variables used in each equation include the average PPF, T, and CO2 values (averaged from planting date up to
	the current time increment t), and the total or yield dry mass at t-1.

	The model-based predictive controller adjusts light intensity, atmospheric/elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration,
	(photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), average daily air temperature (T),

12. E.A. Mitsherlich (1909) proposed a theory of “Law of diminishing returns” states that,
	‘The increase in any crop produce by a unit increment of a deficient factor is proportional to the
	decrement of that factor from the maximum and the response is curvilinear instead of linear’.
	Mitscherlich equation is dy/dx = C (A-Y) where,

		d – increment or change
		dy – amount of increase in yield
		dx – amount of increment of the growth factor x.
		A – Maximum possible yield
		Y – Yield obtained for the given quantity of factor ‘x’ and
		C – Proportionality constant that depends on the nature of the growth factor

	in mars-sim, 

		maximum harvest = max harvest mass [Kg per day] * crop's growing day,
		
		max harvest mass is affected by the availability of
		1. fertilizer
		2. water
		3. CO2
		4. O2
		5. sunlight
		6. planting/daily tending work required vs. served, 
		
		
		
13. In Mars-sim, there are 4 standard phases of a food crop:

	a. Planting
	b. germinating
	c. growing
	d. harvesting

	In reality, each crop category have various phenological stage

15. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5642E/x5642e06.htm),
there is 9 types of vegetable crops based on edible part:
	
	a. Root vegetables (carrots, beetroot, radish)
	b. Tuber vegetables (Yam, Irish potato) 
	c. Corm (Taro)
	d. Stem vegetable (Asparagus)
	e  Leaf vegetables (Lettuce, Amaranth)
	f  Bulb vegetable (Onion, garlic)
	g. Fruit vegetable (Tomato, okra)
	h. Flower vegetables (Broccoli, Cauliflower)
	i. Seed vegetable (Berus, Peas)	
	
	for root/tuber/corm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_root_vegetables
		
	in mars-sim, we have 14 categories:

	roots
	tubers
	corms
	stems
	leaves
	bulbs
	fruits
	flowers
	seeds
	legumes
	grains
	grasses
	fungi
	spices
