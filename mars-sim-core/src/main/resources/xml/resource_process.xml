	<process name="Photosynthetic Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene" power-required="1.0" >
		<description>
		The direct conversion of carbon dioxide to ethylene using cyanobacteria involves an engineered 
		photosynthetic process. While natural photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen from carbon 
		dioxide and water, the engineered system described in research allows cyanobacteria to use 
		electricity and light to convert carbon dioxide into ethylene (C₂H₄) or acetate.
		
 		The specific chemical reaction for ethylene production is not a standard natural photosynthetic
 		equation but results from a modified pathway.
 		
	    2CO2 + 4H+ + 2e- + light energy -> C2H4 + 2O2 
	     g/mol :                 88 + 4 -> 2*12+ 4 + 2 * 32 
	                                         28  + 64
	    
	    This reaction is driven by an artificial system that replaces photosystem II, allowing electrons 
	    from an external source (electricity) and light to power the reduction of CO₂ to ethylene via 
	    photosystem I in engineered cyanobacteria.
	    
 		This approach bypasses the inefficiencies of natural photosynthesis, such as overlapping light 
 		absorption spectra and competition between oxygen and carbon dioxide for the carbon-fixing enzyme.

	     The term "fibres" mostly means cellulose, which is a polysaccharide molecule, 
	     i.e. it is composed of hundreds or thousands of glucose molecules connected to 
	     each other by glycosidic bonds.
	     
	     Cow has intestinal flora that contain bacterias that can break down β(1→4) bonds,
	     live on the energy these bonds contain, and as a consequence provide the host 
	     with the resulting glucose.

		 Cellulase is a group of enzymes (amylase, lipase and protease) that break down 
		 cellulose into its component glucose molecules.

	<process name="Sabatier RWGS Reactor" power-required="0.12" defaultOn="true">
	<description> 
	 A. Sabatier process :

		CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O, exothermic heat = -165 kJ/mol

		CO2 : 44 g/mol
		4H2 : 8 g/mol
		CH4 : 16 g/mol
		2H2O : 36 g/mol

		B. The Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process is a
		candidate technology for water and oxygen production
		on Mars. RWGS uses carbon dioxide and hydrogen as
		reactants to produce oxygen and carbon monoxide with a
		copper on alumina catalyst, or in the precsence of an
		iron-chrome catalyst.

		CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O

		Because the RWGS reaction is only mildly endothermic (at 400 deg C,
		9 kcal/mole for RWGS compared to 57 kcal/mole for water electrolysis),
		it's better than just having the water electrolysis alone.

		Moreover, since the thermal power required by the RWGS is less than that
		produced by the Sabatier reactor and their operating temperatures are comparable, a
		Sabatier reactor can be used to provide the heat required to drive the RWGS
		reactor.
	
	 B. Sabatier with Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) :

		3CO2 + 6H2 -> CH4 + 2CO + 4H2O, exothermic heat = -83 kJ/mol

		3CO2 : 132 g/mol
		6H2 : 12 g/mol
		CH4 : 16 g/mol
		2CO : 56 g/mol
		4H2O : 72 g/mol

		The primary disadvantage of the Sabatier process is that twice
		as much hydrogen is consumed as can be recovered by the
		electrolysis of the produced water.

		In one in-situ propellant prooduction system (ISPP), it uses
		Sabatier and Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) to convert H2
		and CO2 into OX and CH4 (with CO as waste).  It requires 470 W
		to produce 1 kg of propellant per sol, per Zurin's paper on
		"Integrated Mars In-Situ Propellant Production System.

	<process name="Continuous Bosch Reactor (C-Bosch)" power-required="0.05" >
		<description> 						
		In recent years, under the SpaceCraft Oxygen Recovery (SCOR) program, 
		NASA seeks to increase oxygen recovery beyond the state of the art (42%) 
		to at least 75% and approaching 100%.
				
		1. Space oxygen recovery technologies implemented include carbon formation reactors (CFR) 
		and methane plasma pyrolysis assembly (PPA) reactors. 
				
		2. The Continuous Bosch Reactor (C-Bosch) - aims to produce water and 
		elemental carbon from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Highly efficient for 
		utilization of hydrogen, it would replace the current state-of-the-art 
		Sabatier reactor.
		
		3. Hydrogen Recovery by Carbon Vapor Deposition aims to do what Sabatier
		lacks, namely, recovering hydrogen. The Sabatier is limited in its ability 
		to recover oxygen from carbon dioxide due to an insufficient amount of hydrogen. 
		
		The Sabatier requires additional hydrogen due to the production of the 
		byproduct methane. If hydrogen can be recovered from this byproduct, it 
		can be sent back to the Sabatier to react with carbon dioxide and produce 
		additional oxygen.
		
		- A high-temperature solid oxide co-electrolyzer (SOCE) is to be combined 
		with a carbon formation reactor.
		
		C-Bosch Reactor reduces CO2 to C and H20 using H2:

		Challenge : 
		1. power consumption - high temperature endothermic reactions, catalyst

			This reaction produces acetylene utilizing the electrochemical reduction

			Acetylene is generated by the reaction between water and metal carbides,

			CO2 is first converted to metallic carbides such as CaC2 and Li2C2,

		Oxygen Generation System can split water into H2 and O2.
	
		NASA's Oxygen Generation System is designed to generate
		oxygen from 5 to 20 pounds (2.3 to 9 kg) of oxygen per day
		during continuous operation and a normal rate of 12 pounds
		(5.4 kg) of oxygen per day during cyclic operation.
	
		The Oxygen Generation System will accommodate the testing
		of an experimental Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly
		(CReA). Once deployed, the reduction assembly will cause
		hydrogen produced by the Oxygen Generation Assembly to
		react with carbon dioxide removed from the cabin atmosphere
		to produce water and methane.
	
		It uses 1312 W of power.
	
		Available water electrolysis units using solid polymer
		electrolytes are highly efficient (>90%) and extremely rugged,
		as they have been designed for nuclear submarine use with
		specifications that include resistance to depth charge attack,
		per Zubrin, et al.
	
		During normal operations on the ISS, approximately 23 L water

			According to https://marspedia.org/Nitrogen, 
			Nitrates with a concentration of ~100 ppm have been found in typical Martian soils.
			Curiosity found Nitrate deposits in Gale Crater from ~110 to ~300 ppm. In Mudstone deposits, 
			this value ranged from 300 to 1,100 ppm. They speculate that these compounds were formed from thermal shock from impacts, or from lightning.

		<description>
			Soda is sodium carbonate. That is a salt. Sodium exists in Martian regolith as an
			oxide or super oxide and can be converted into soda. Dissolve the sodium oxide
			in water, then bubble carbon dioxide through the water. Oxygen will be released and soda created.
			Boil down the result to extract the water and you have soda.
			
			NaCl: 58.44 g/mol
			Na: 23 g/mol
			Cl: 35.44 g/mol
			Na2CO3: 106 g/mol
			CO2: 44 g/mol
			
			Alternatively, 
			1. Labnac Process: Another method for producing sodium carbonate is the Labnac process, which involves the reaction of sodium chloride (NaCl) with ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This process is similar to the Solvay process but uses a different sequence of reactions:
			2. Ammoniation: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is dissolved in water and mixed with ammonia (NH3) to form sodium ammonium chloride (NaNH4Cl).
			3. Carbonation: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is bubbled through the solution to convert sodium ammonium chloride to sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).
			4. Calcination: The resulting precipitate is filtered, washed, and then calcined (heated) to produce anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3).

		<description>
		Makes sulfur concrete using sulfur as the cement, with sand and regolith as aggregates.	
		The sulfur concrete making process involves heating sulfur to 240 C, over twice its melting point. 
		This liquid sulfur is mixed with the abundant Martian soil, then left to cool. 
		The sulfur and soil bind together to create solid concrete. 	
		Cement and water, important compounds in normal concrete, are not part of sulfur concrete. 
		
		A mixture of 50 percent sulfur and 50 percent Martian soil with a particle size of 1 mm resulted 
		in a compressive strength of 50 MPa that's twice the regular concrete. 
		
		It also had about twice the compressive strength of sulfur concrete made with sand aggregate.
