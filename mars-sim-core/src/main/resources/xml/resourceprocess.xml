	<process name="Sabatier RWGS Reactor" power-required="0.12" defaultOn="true">
	<description> 
	 A. Sabatier process :

		CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O, exothermic heat = -165 kJ/mol

		CO2 : 44 g/mol
		4H2 : 8 g/mol
		CH4 : 16 g/mol
		2H2O : 36 g/mol

		B. The Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process is a
		candidate technology for water and oxygen production
		on Mars. RWGS uses carbon dioxide and hydrogen as
		reactants to produce oxygen and carbon monoxide with a
		copper on alumina catalyst, or in the precsence of an
		iron-chrome catalyst.

		CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O

		Because the RWGS reaction is only mildly endothermic (at 400 deg C,
		9 kcal/mole for RWGS compared to 57 kcal/mole for water electrolysis),
		it's better than just having the water electrolysis alone.

		Moreover, since the thermal power required by the RWGS is less than that
		produced by the Sabatier reactor and their operating temperatures are comparable, a
		Sabatier reactor can be used to provide the heat required to drive the RWGS
		reactor.
	
	 B. Sabatier with Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) :

		3CO2 + 6H2 -> CH4 + 2CO + 4H2O, exothermic heat = -83 kJ/mol

		3CO2 : 132 g/mol
		6H2 : 12 g/mol
		CH4 : 16 g/mol
		2CO : 56 g/mol
		4H2O : 72 g/mol

		The primary disadvantage of the Sabatier process is that twice
		as much hydrogen is consumed as can be recovered by the
		electrolysis of the produced water.

		In one in-situ propellant prooduction system (ISPP), it uses
		Sabatier and Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) to convert H2
		and CO2 into OX and CH4 (with CO as waste).  It requires 470 W
		to produce 1 kg of propellant per sol, per Zurin's paper on
		"Integrated Mars In-Situ Propellant Production System.

		We assume a system that's 4 times more efficient in producing
		CH4 below

		CO2 : 39.6 kg/sol
		4H2 : 3.6 kg/sol
		CH4 : 4.8 kg/sol
		2CO : 16.8 g/mol
		4H2O : 21.6 kg/sol

	<process name="Carbon Formation Reactor" power-required="0.05" >
		<description> 						
		In recent years, under the SpaceCraft Oxygen Recovery (SCOR) program, 
		NASA seeks to increase oxygen recovery beyond the state of the art (42%) 
		to at least 75% and approaching 100%.
				
		Space oxygen recovery technologies implemented include carbon formation reactors (CFR) 
		and methane pyrolysis assembly (PPA) reactors. 
				
		1. The Continuous Bosch Reactor (C-Bosch) - aims to produce water and elemental carbon from hydrogen 
		and carbon dioxide. Highly efficient for utilization of hydrogen, it would replace the 
		current state-of-the-art Sabatier reactor.
		
		2. Hydrogen Recovery by Carbon Vapor Deposition - aims to do what Sabatier lacks: recover 
		hydrogen. The Sabatier is limited in its ability to recover oxygen from carbon dioxide 
		due to an insufficient amount of hydrogen. The Sabatier requires additional hydrogen 
		due to the production of the byproduct methane. If hydrogen can be recovered from this 
		byproduct, it can be sent back to the Sabatier to react with carbon dioxide and produce 
		additional oxygen.
		
		- A high-temperature solid oxide co-electrolyzer (SOCE) is to be combined with a carbon
		formation reactor.
		
		-----------------------
		
		C-Bosch Reactor reduces CO2 to C(s) and H20 using H2. 
		
		It aims to produce water and elemental carbon from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. 
				Based on Bosch System : 
							 2CO -> CO2 + C(s)
						 CO + H2 -> H2O + C(s)
						3CO + H2 -> CO2 + H2O + 2C(s)
					3*28 g   2 g	44 g   18 g   24 g
					
		Challenges : 
		1. power consumption - high temperature endothermic reactions, catalyst resupply, volume/mass.

	<process name="Oxygen Generation System" power-required="0.25" defaultOn="true">
	<description> 
	
		Oxygen Generation System can split water into H2 and O2.
	
		NASA's Oxygen Generation System is designed to generate
		oxygen from 5 to 20 pounds (2.3 to 9 kg) of oxygen per day
		during continuous operation and a normal rate of 12 pounds
		(5.4 kg) of oxygen per day during cyclic operation.
	
		The Oxygen Generation System will accommodate the testing
		of an experimental Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly
		(CReA). Once deployed, the reduction assembly will cause
		hydrogen produced by the Oxygen Generation Assembly to
		react with carbon dioxide removed from the cabin atmosphere
		to produce water and methane.
	
		Oxygen Generator Assembly (OGA) uses 1312 W of power.
	
		Available water electrolysis units using solid polymer
		electrolytes are highly efficient (>90%) and extremely rugged,
		as they have been designed for nuclear submarine use with
		specifications that include resistance to depth charge attack,
		per Zubrin, et al.
	
		During normal operations on the ISS, approximately 23 L water
		per day is used by the OGS with a constant current of 50 ampere
		to each electrolytic cell in the OGS system
	
		2H2O -> 2H2 + O2
	
		2H2O : 36 g/mol
		2H2 : 4 g/mol
		O2 : 32 g/mol
	
		50A * 120 = 6kW
	
		We assume by use of nanosheet and synthesizing appropriate electrocatalyst, 
		a much lower power usage of 125W system is required for splitting 18 kg water 
		into 2 kg H2 and 16 kg O2.

	<process name="Low Temperature Plasma CO2 Decomposition" power-required="0.1" defaultOn="true">
		<description> 
			The atmosphere is mainly CO2, so there is no need to capture it and plasma can 
			be ignited in ambient Martian atmosphere. 
			
			The traces of Ar and N2 present can only help: argon aids shaping the electron 
			energy distribution to higher energies, contributing to an increased efficiency
			of this decomposition process.
			
			The pressure on Mars – of 600 Pa (4.5 Torr), about 150 times lower than on Earth 
			– is close to the ideal for advantageous plasma operation, so there is no need 
			to use vacuum pumps or compressors on the first steps of the process.

		<description> Melting permafrost ice and filtering the water.

			Specific heat capacity of ice is 2.09 J/g/C	
					
			e.g. For 1 mol of ice, from -25 C to 0 C
			      = 18 g * 2.09 * (0 -(-25)) = 0.941 kJ		
				
			To transition from ice to liquid, it takes a total of 6.02 kJ/mol			
			Specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g/C	
					
			To warm liquid water to vapor, it takes a total of 7.52 kJ/mol			
			It's (.941 + 6.02) kJ / 18 g = 386.7 kJ / kg	
						
			For 1 kg, heating for 25 millisols,
			Heat req = 386.7 kJ/(88.775244*25) = 0.1742 kW / kg

			Soda is sodium carbonate. That is a salt. Sodium exists in Martian regolith as an

			Boil down the result to extract the water and you have soda.

	<process name="Mix sulfur concrete" power-required="0.2" >
		<description>
		Makes sulfur concrete using sulfur as the cement, with sand and regolith as aggregates.
		
		The sulfur concrete making process involves heating sulfur to 240 C, over twice its melting point. 
		
		This liquid sulfur is mixed with the abundant Martian soil, then left to cool. 
		
		The sulfur and soil bind together to create solid concrete. 
		
		Cement and water, important compounds in normal concrete, are not part of sulfur concrete. 
		
		A mixture of 50 percent sulfur and 50 percent Martian soil with a particle size of 1 mm resulted 
		in a compressive strength of 50 MPa that's twice the regular concrete. 
		
		It also had about twice the compressive strength of sulfur concrete made with sand aggregate.
