		Corn stover is a broad term which describes all of the above ground biomass
		from the corn crop except the grain. This biomass is comprised of structural
		components including stalks, leaves, tassel, husk, and cob. The U.S. Department of
		Energy estimates that over 76 million metric tons of corn stover are available from the
		roughly 28 million hectares of corn produced each year (Perlack, 2005).  

		Worldwide, with a yield of over 5 T/ha . Production can be significantly higher in certain regions of the world;
		2009 forecasts for production in Iowa were 11614 kg/ha

		Use (11.6 + 5)/2 = 8.30 T/ha

			Plants
			Peanut plant blossoms are small and yellow, resembling the flowers of the pea plant. After pollination and 
			fertilization, the peg takes 10 days to bend down and penetrate the soil. About a week later, the tip of the peg
			begins to enlarge and the pod and kernel begin to develop. Another nine or 10 weeks will pass before the pods

		Sweet Potato tubers only contain root cells and grow on rhizomes. 
		In order to grow a new sweet potato plant, part of the root cap must be present to have Sweet potatoes
		Sweet Potato are commonly misnamed yams in the United States.  
		
		Potato is not related to the Sweet potato because Potato tubers consist of the enlarged or thickened portions of underground stems commonly called stolons. 
		The tubers form at the distal end of the stolon and/or along the stolon itself. 
		Tubers have all the characterists of normal stems, including nodes or eyes. A branch or stem can grow from the node to make a new plant. 

		To recap, sweet potato is a root tuber, potato is a stem tuber.

8.  Lighting Radiation Conversion

	Plants use light energy between 300/400 nm and 700 nm, the region known as 
	Photosynthetically Active Radiation or PAR.

	Illumination for plants, also known as "irradiance", is sometimes measured in PAR watts per square meter (W/m2).
	
	Another means of measuring light quantity for plant growth involves discrete units of quantum flux in the PAR
	region called "photons". This light measurement is an instantaneous reading.
	
	Researchers measure instantaneous light in terms of photon flux commonly measured in units of 
	micromoles per square meter per second [µmoles/m2/s or μmol·m-2·s-1 of PAR], where 1 mole of photons is equal to 
	6.022 x 1023 photons. 

	This quantum unit quantifies the number of photons (individual particles of energy) used in photosynthesis that 
	fall on a square meter (10.8 square feet) every second.

	Daily light integral (DLI) or Daily PAR is the amount of PAR received each day as a function of light intensity 
	(instantaneous light: μmol·m-2·s-1) and duration (day).
	
	It is expressed	as moles of light (mol) per square meter (m-2) per day (d-1), or: mol·m-2·d-1 (moles per day).
	The DLI concept is like a rain gauge.

	Just as a rain gauge collects the total rain in a particular location over a period of time, so DLI measures 
	the total amount of PAR received in a day.

	Greenhouse growers can use light meters to measure the number of light photons that accumulate in a square meter 
	over a 24-hour period.

9. How much light do plants need?

	• Propagation of plugs and cuttings: 8-12 mol/m2/day (after callus)
	• Bedding plants: 10-12 mol/m2/day or greater
	• Vegetables
		o Hydroponic lettuce 15-17 mol/m2/day if vertical airflow fans are used (greater than
		  this can cause leaf tip burn, a physiological disorder from calcium deficiency that
		  occurs under high light)
		o Tomatoes 20-30+ mol/m2/day (for maximum yield)

11. MPR Model: a crop model that consists of a set of nonlinear polynomial equations, six for each crop,
	developed using multivariate polynomial regression (MPR).

	The dependent variables for three of the six MPR equations are the relative growth rates
	of (a) total dry mass prior to formation of yield bearing organs, (b) total dry mass after the
	formation of yield bearing organs, and (c) yield dry mass.

	The independent variables used in each equation include the average PPF, T, and CO2 values (averaged from planting date up to
	the current time increment t), and the total or yield dry mass at t-1.

	The model-based predictive controller adjusts light intensity, atmospheric/elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration,
	(photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), average daily air temperature (T),

12. E.A. Mitsherlich (1909) proposed a theory of “Law of diminishing returns” states that,
	‘The increase in any crop produce by a unit increment of a deficient factor is proportional to the
	decrement of that factor from the maximum and the response is curvilinear instead of linear’.
	Mitscherlich equation is dy/dx = C (A-Y) where,

		d – increment or change
		dy – amount of increase in yield
		dx – amount of increment of the growth factor x.
		A – Maximum possible yield
		Y – Yield obtained for the given quantity of factor ‘x’ and
		C – Proportionality constant that depends on the nature of the growth factor

	In mars-sim,

		Maximum harvest = max harvest mass [kg per day] * crop's growing day,

		Max harvest mass is daily modified by the availability of

		1. fertilizer
		2. water
		3. CO2
		4. O2
		5. sunlight
		6. planting/daily tending work required vs. served


13. Prior to mars-sim version 3.1.0, there are 4 standard phases of a food crop:

	a. Planting
	b. Germination
	c. Growing
	d. Harvesting

15. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5642E/x5642e06.htm),
	there is 9 types of vegetable crops based on edible part:

	a. Root vegetables (carrots, beetroot, radish)
	b. Tuber vegetables (Yam, Irish potato)
	c. Corm (Taro)
	d. Stem vegetable (Asparagus)
	e  Leaf vegetables (Lettuce, Amaranth)
	f  Bulb vegetable (Onion, garlic)
	g. Fruit vegetable (Tomato, okra)
	h. Flower vegetables (Broccoli, Cauliflower)
	i. Seed vegetable (Berus, Peas)

	for root/tuber/corm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_root_vegetables

	http://www.passthepistil.com/transplanting-seedlings-vs-direct-sowing-seeds/

18. Annuals - Plants that perform their entire life cycle from seed to flower
	to seed within a single growing season. All roots, stems and leaves of the plant die annually.
	Only the dormant seed bridges the gap between one generation and the next.

	Annuals: amaranth, bean, broccoli*, corn, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, fava, gourd, ground cherry,
	 lettuce, lima, melon, mustard, okra, pea, peanut, pepper, poppy, potato, radish (non-daikon),
	  runner bean, sorghum, spinach, squash, sunflower, tomatillo, tomato, watermelon

	Perennials - Plants that persist for many growing seasons. Generally the top portion of
	the plant dies back each winter and regrows the following spring from the same root system
	(e.g. Purple Coneflower). Many perennial plants do keep their leaves year round and offer
	attractive borders and groundcover (e.g. Tickseed, Shasta and Ox-Eyed Daisy).

	NOTE: WHEN STARTING PERENNIAL PLANTS FROM SEED, BLOOMS WILL BE OBSERVED IN EITHER THE SPRING
	OR SUMMER OF THE SECOND YEAR AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER (e.g. Ox-Eyed Daisy planted in the
	spring of 1996 will not bloom until the spring of 1997).

	Biennials - Plants which require two years to complete their life cycle. First season growth
	results in a small rosette of leaves near the soil surface. During the second season's
	growth stem elongation, flowering and seed formation occur followed by the entire plant's death.

	Biennials: beet, broccoli*, Brussels sprout, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celeriac, celery, 
	chicory, Chinese cabbage, collard, endive, kale, kohlrabi, leek, onion, parsley, parsnip, 
	radish (daikon), rutabaga, Swiss chard, turnip


	Annual/Perennial - A plant can behave as an annual or a perennial depending on local climatic
	and geographic growing conditions. In the southern portion of the United States, these plants
	tend to grow much quicker than in the north due to the warmer weather and extended growing season.

	For example: a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as an annual if grown in Louisiana; whereas,
	if grown in Ohio, a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as a perennial.

	See http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html

	Today’s savvy gardeners should also expand their plant life cycle know-how to be able to characterize
	winter annuals and tender perennials, as well as long- and short-lived perennials.

	Some perennial plants are woody and will flower and fruit after several years of juvenile growth, 
	while others are herbaceous and die back every winter to newly flower and fruit in the spring. 
	
	"Tender perennials" are very sensitive to cold temperatures and are grown as annuals in most climates. 
	
	Several of our beds feature tender perennials like tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and okra that will 
	die back at the end of the season due to cold weather.
	
19. Legume Green Manuring
    http://soiltosupper.com/why-green-manure-crops-are-good-for-your-soil/	
    http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/%24department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex133
    
    Being a legume, Pigeon Pea has the ability to obtain and store nitrogen. This happens with the aid of 
    bacteria called ‘Rhizobium’. These bacteria live in nodules on the plants roots and can take nitrogen
    from the air and convert it for the plants use. This is called ‘Nitrogen Fixation’. 
     
    To allow for this process and to use Pigeon Pea and other legumes as a nitrogen improver, the seeds of
    this plant must have an inoculant present when sown. The inoculant contains the bacteria needed for 
    the specific legume.

21. root tuber vs. stem tuber

	http://www.biology.lifeeasy.org/3344/difference-between-root-tuber-and-stem-tuber
		
	e.g. sweet potato is a root tuber, potato is a stem tuber. 
		
	Stem tubers have apical bud, nodes and internodes, scaly leaves and auxiliary buds, and the ability to develop chlorophyll when exposed to sunlight. 
	Root tubers do not have these attributes. Both are considered vegetables.

	Root tuber	
	1.    It is a swollen root	
	2.    Apical bud is absent	
	3.    Nodes and internodes are absent	
	4.    No development of chlorophyll
	5.    Scaly leaves and auxiliary buds are absent.


	Stem tuber
	1. It is a swollen underground stem
	2. Apical bud is present
	3. Presence of nodes and internodes
	4. On exposure to sunlight, stem tubers may develop chlorophyll
	5. Scaly leaves and auxiliary buds are present.

	Corms vs. Bulbs :
	
	Bulbs can be broken down into five types of storage structures. 
	These include: true bulbs, corms, tubers, tuberous roots and rhizomes. 
	A sixth category of fleshy roots has been added here for the purpose of showing the structure. 
	e.g. Daylilies and peonies, are popular bulb plants with gardeners.
	
	A corm is a swollen stem base that is modified into a mass of storage tissue. 
	A corm does not have visible storage rings when cut in half. This distinguishes it from a true bulb.
	The corm contains a basal plate (bottom of bulb from which roots develop),thin tunic and a growing point. 
	e.g. Plants that develop from corms include gladiolus, crocus, and autumn crocus.
