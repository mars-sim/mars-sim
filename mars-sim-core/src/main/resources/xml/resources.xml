<!-- Mineral Elements 
 
    On Earth, vast volcanic landscapes are called "Large Igneous Provinces" 
    (LIP's); such places are sources of nickel, copper, titanium, iron, 
    platinum, palladium, and chromium.[4][23] Mars's Tharsis region, 
    which contains a group of giant volcanoes, is considered to be an LIP.
    
	Dark sand dunes are common on the surface of Mars. Their dark tone is due 
	to the volcanic rock called basalt. The basalt dunes are believed to 
	contain the minerals chromite, magnetite, and ilmenite.
	
	Since the wind has gathered them together, they do not even have to be 
	mined, merely scooped up.These minerals could supply future colonists 
	with chromium, iron, and titanium.

    http://en.wiki2.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment : Nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process, each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2−) is most often facilitated by Nitrosomonas spp. ("nitroso" referring to the formation of a nitroso functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO3−), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by Nitrobacter spp. (nitro referring the formation of a nitro functional group), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by Nitrospira spp.
