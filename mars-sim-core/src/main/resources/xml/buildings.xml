				<!-- A. Sabatier process :

					CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O, exothermic heat = -165 kJ/mol
	
					CO2 : 44 g/mol
					4H2 : 8 g/mol
					CH4 : 16 g/mol
					2H2O : 36 g/mol
	
					B. The Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process is a
					candidate technology for water and oxygen production
					on Mars. RWGS uses carbon dioxide and hydrogen as
					reactants to produce oxygen and carbon monoxide with a
					copper on alumina catalyst, or in the precsence of an
					iron-chrome catalyst.
	
					CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O
	
					Because the RWGS reaction is only mildly endothermic (at 400 deg C,
					9 kcal/mole for RWGS compared to 57 kcal/mole for water electrolysis),
					it's better than just having the water electrolysis alone.
	
					Moreover, since the thermal power required by the RWGS is less than that
					produced by the Sabatier reactor and their operating temperatures are comparable, a
					Sabatier reactor can be used to provide the heat required to drive the RWGS
					reactor.
	
					C. Sabatier with Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) :
	
					3CO2 + 6H2 -> CH4 + 2CO + 4H2O, exothermic heat = -83 kJ/mol
	
					3CO2 : 132 g/mol
					6H2 : 12 g/mol
					CH4 : 16 g/mol
					2CO : 56 g/mol
					4H2O : 72 g/mol
	
					The primary disadvantage of the Sabatier process is that twice
					as much hydrogen is consumed as can be recovered by the
					electrolysis of the produced water.
	
					In one in-situ propellant prooduction system (ISPP), it uses
					Sabatier and Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) to convert H2
					and CO2 into OX and CH4 (with CO as waste).  It requires 470 W
					to produce 1 kg of propellant per sol, per Zurin's paper on
					"Integrated Mars In-Situ Propellant Production System.
	
					We assume a system that's 4 times more efficient in producing
					CH4 below
	
					CO2 : 39.6 kg/sol
					4H2 : 3.6 kg/sol
					CH4 : 4.8 kg/sol
					2CO : 16.8 g/mol
					4H2O : 21.6 kg/sol

				<!-- Oxygen Generation System can split water into H2 and O2.

				NASA's Oxygen Generation System is designed to generate
				oxygen from 5 to 20 pounds (2.3 to 9 kg) of oxygen per day
				during continuous operation and a normal rate of 12 pounds
				(5.4 kg) of oxygen per day during cyclic operation.

				The Oxygen Generation System will accommodate the testing
				of an experimental Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly
				(CReA). Once deployed, the reduction assembly will cause
				hydrogen produced by the Oxygen Generation Assembly to
				react with carbon dioxide removed from the cabin atmosphere
				to produce water and methane.

				Oxygen Generator Assembly (OGA) uses 1312 W of power.

				https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/104840main_eclss.pdf

				See also https://www.quora.com/How-is-oxygen-generated-on-the-ISS

				Available water electrolysis units using solid polymer
				electrolytes are highly efficient (>90%) and extremely rugged,
				as they have been designed for nuclear submarine use with
				specifications that include resistance to depth charge attack,
				per Zubrin, et al.

				During normal operations on the ISS, approximately 23 L water
				per day is used by the OGS with a constant current of 50 ampere
				to each electrolytic cell in the OGS system

				2H2O -> 2H2 + O2

				2H2O : 36 g/mol
				2H2 : 4 g/mol
				O2 : 32 g/mol

				50A * 120 = 6kW

				https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/570243main_OxygenGen_CHEM_ST.pdf

				We assume a power usage of 1kW system for splitting 18 kg water
				into 2 kg H2 and 16 kg O2

					<description> Melting permafrost ice and filtering the water. 
						Requires 450kJ/kg extraction energy.
						
						Specific heat capacity of ice is 2.09 J/g/C
				
						e.g. For 1 mol of ice, from -25 C to 0 C
						= 18 g * 2.09 * (0 -(-25)) = 0.941 kJ
				
						To transition from ice to liquid, it takes a total of 6.02 kJ/mol
				
						Specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g/C
				
						To warm liquid water to vapor, it takes a total of 7.52 kJ/mol
				
						It's (.941 + 6.02) kJ / 18 g = 386.7 kJ / kg
				
						For 1 kg, heating for 25 millisols,
						Heat req = 386.7 kJ/(88.775244*25) = 0.1742 kW / kg
				
						or 1.3939 kW for 8 kg of ice
										
						See "Water and Brines on Mars: Current Evidence and Implications for MSL", 2013						
						
						Note: assume using vacuum chamber, microwaving, or field effects, electrocatalysis, 
						or other techniques to reduce power usage of ice melting by ~10-fold.
