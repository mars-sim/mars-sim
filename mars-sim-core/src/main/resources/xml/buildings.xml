				A. Sabatier process :

				CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O, exothermic heat = -165 kJ/mol

				CO2 : 44 g/mol
				4H2 : 8 g/mol
				CH4 : 16 g/mol
				2H2O : 36 g/mol
				
				
				B. The Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process is a
				candidate technology for water and oxygen production
				on Mars. RWGS uses carbon dioxide and hydrogen as
				reactants to produce oxygen and carbon monoxide with a
				copper on alumina catalyst.
				
				CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O

				Because the RWGS reaction is only mildly endothermic (9 kcal/mole for RWGS
				compared to 57 kcal/mole for water electrolysis), system power requirements are
				dominated by the water electrolysis step, the available technology for which is highly
				efficient. Moreover, since the thermal power required by the RWGS is less than that
				produced by the Sabatier reactor and their operating temperatures are comparable, a
				Sabatier reactor can be used to provide the heat required to drive the RWGS
				reactor.

				C. Sabatier with Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) :  
					
				3CO2 + 6H2 -> CH4 + 2CO + 4H2O, exothermic heat = -83 kJ/mol
				
				3CO2 : 132 g/mol
				6H2 : 12 g/mol
				CH4 : 16 g/mol
				2CO : 56 g/mol
				4H2O : 72 g/mol
				
				The primary disadvantage of the Sabatier process is that twice 
				as much hydrogen is consumed as can be recovered by the 
				electrolysis of the produced water.
				
				In one in-situ propellant prooduction system (ISPP), it uses
				Sabatier and Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) to convert H2 
				and CO2 into OX and CH4 (with CO as waste).  It requires 470 W
				to produce 1 kg of propellant per sol, per Zurin's paper on
				"Integrated Mars In-Situ Propellant Production System.
				
				We assume a system that's 4 times more efficient in producing
				CH4 below
				
				CO2 : 39.6 kg/sol
				4H2 : 3.6 kg/sol
				CH4 : 4.8 kg/sol

				(5.4 kg) of oxygen per day during cyclic operation.
				
				The Oxygen Generation System will accommodate the testing
				of an experimental Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly
				(CReA). Once deployed, the reduction assembly will cause
				hydrogen produced by the Oxygen Generation Assembly to
				react with carbon dioxide removed from the cabin atmosphere
				to produce water and methane. 
				
				Oxygen Generator Assembly (OGA) uses 1312 W of power.
