<H2 class="pageTitle">Backstory</H2>
<P>It is the year of 2028. Humanity has finally broken new ground in reaching and settling Mars. 
It's a massive undertaking, sponsored and kick-started by numerous space agencies and space 
enterprises. Now new colonies are being established all over on this new continent, forming new
 human societies as we speak in this brave new world.</P>

<P>No two settlements look alike. One settlement may start from a simple 
four-person Lander Hab with an EVA Airlock and an Inflatable Greenhouse. The another settlement may
start with a Lander Hab, an EVA Airlock and a Fishery. Down the road, each settlement will find 
its own destiny, endeavors to undertake, new objectives to meet and an identity to embrace. </P> 

<P>Without a doubt, there are also mining towns and trading outposts sprawling up and specializing
in prospecting ores and minerals as they secure mining rights as quick as they can.</P>

<P>Thankfully, settlers are by and large happy, skillful and resourceful. They are bringing in their
unique areas of expertise as pioneers to settle this new world. Some find their fulfillment in 
experimenting with food crops and tending greenhouses to feed the populace. Some are leaning toward
manufacturing useful daily items and parts. Some prospect ores and mine precious metal and minerals. 
Some are handy enough to maintain a fleets of ready vehicles and repair equipment. Some do field
trips out there to survey ancient dry lake beds and engage with others in scientific inquiries about the 
origin of life, etc.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, space tourists have also taken notice and are beginning to trickle in to get a taste of the 
ultimate adventure as well as visiting landmarks.</P>

<P>Mars's magnificent landscape is an untamed beauty and it can be hostile to the unsuspected. 
Has it always been a big, lifeless rock? Its past ecosystems, if any, await humanity's further 
investigations. </P>

<P>Reality is far from perfect, settlers still come face-to-face with meteorite impacts, 
radiation sickness, equipment malfunctions, accidents, illnesses, injuries, and even death. 
Sometimes survival depends on how well they work together in harmony, how they use their attributes,
instincts, and skills, and how well they balance their individual vs. collective needs. </P>

<P>As settlers survive hardship and build up their settlements, they are rewarded with the pure
 joy of participating in this grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society 
 on another planetary surface.</P>

<P>Living and thriving on Mars is full of challenges and surprises for sure. There are no one
single recipe for success that one can follow. But at the end, it will worth the sum of all 
our efforts as we are becoming a multi-planetary species continuing our stories of living among 
the stars.</P>
