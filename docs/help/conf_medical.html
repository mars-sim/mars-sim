<P>The medical.xml configuration file contains configuration for medical problems that settlers can suffer from.  New medical
problems can be added and existing ones edited.</P>

<P>A "medical-complaint" element has a unique "name" attribute.  It also has the following child elements:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>seriousness:</B> The seriousness of the malfunction as an integer value between 1 and 100 (100 being most serious).
This is used to determine the order that doctors will attempt to treat multiple medical problems.  This element is required
for all medical complaints.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>degrade-time:</B> The time (sols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) before this medical problem 
degrades to a more serious medical problem or death if left untreated.  This element is optional and is only for degrading 
medical problems.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>recovery-time:</B> The time (sols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) for the person to recover from the affects of the medical
problem after it has been treated.  This element is required for all medical complaints.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>probability:</B> The probability weight of the malfunction happening as a decimal value from 0.0 (no chance) to 100.0
(very likely).  This is its probability that this medical problem can happen to a person randomly without an outside cause (such 
as a malfunction).  This element is required for all medical complaints.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>performance-percent:</B> The percentage of normal activity performance the person has while suffering from this
health problem.  This is a decimal value from 0.0 (bedridden) to 100.0 (normal performance).  This element is required for all
medical complaints.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>treatment:</B> The medical treatment that will fix this problem and will put the patient in recovery.  This treatment
has to be on the treatment-list below.  This element is optional and its absence means the medical complaint doesn't need treatment
and the patient will go into recovery immediately.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>degrade-complaint:</B> The medical complaint this complaint will degrade to if it is left untreated past the degrade-time.
The degrade-complaint must be a valid complaint.  This element is optional and its absence means that this medical complaint will
degrade to death if left untreated.</LI><BR>

</UL>

<P>The "treatment-list" is a list of treatments for medical complaints.  New treatments can be added and existing ones modified.</P>

<P>The "treatment" element has a unique "name" attribute.  It can also have the following optional elements:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>skill:</B> The "medical" skill a person needs to perform this treatment.  This element is optional and its absence means that
this treatment has no medical skill requirement.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>medical-tech-level:</B> The technology level of the medical facility required for this treatment (see 
"conf/tech_level.txt").  This element is optional and its absence means that this treatment can be performed at any medical facility.
</LI><BR>

<LI><B>treatment-time:</B> The time (millisols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required to perform this treatment 
on a medical problem.  This element is optional and its absence means that the treatment is instantaneous</LI><BR>

<LI><B>retainaid:</B> Does the patient need to stay at the medical facility after treatment during the recovery process?  Valid values
are "true" and "false".  This element is optional and its absence means that retainaid is not required.</LI><BR>

</UL>
