<P>A person starts with a random set of skills (possibly none).  When a person performs a task, he/she gains experience in the skill(s) 
  associated with the task.  When the experience in a skill passes a threshold, the skill level increases.  The threshold for each skill 
  doubles for each successive skill level, making it more difficult to reach higher levels.</P>
