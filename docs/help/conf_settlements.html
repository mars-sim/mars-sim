<H2>settlements.xml</H2>
<P>The settlements.xml configuration file contains configuration for settlements, settlement templates and a list of
  random settlement names.</P>
<P>The "settlement-template-list" element is a list of templates that define the building configuration of settlements.  Every 
  settlement is based on a settlement template.</P>
<P>The "template" element has a unique "name" attribute.  Settlements use this name to indicate which template they're based on.  It also
  has the following elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>building:</B> A settlement template may have one or more building elements that comprise the settlement.  Each building element
    must have a "type" attribute that matches a building name in <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">conf/buildings.xml</A>.  The "number" attribute
    is the number of this type of building at the settlement.  A settlement should not have more than one "building" element for a specific
    type of building, but should use the "number" attribute for multiples of a building type.</LI>
  <LI><B>vehicle:</B> A settlement template may have one or more vehicle elements.  Each vehicle element must have a type that matches a 
    rover type in <A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">conf/vehicles.xml</A>.  The "number" attribute is the number of this type of vehicle at the 
    settlement.  A settlement should not have more than one "vehicle" element for a specific type of vehicle, but should use the "number"
    attribute for multiples of a vehicle type.</LI>
  <LI><B>equipment:</B> A settlement template may have one or more equipment elements.  Each equipment element must have a "type" attribute
    that matches an equipment type.  The "number" attribute is the number of this type of equipment at the settlement.  A settlement should
    not have more than one "equipment" element for a specific type of equipment, but should use the "number" attribute for multiples of a
    equipment type.</LI>
  <LI><B>part:</B> A settlement template may have one or more part elements.  Each part element must have a "type" attribute
    that matches a part type (see <A HREF="conf_parts.html">conf/parts.xml</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number of this type of part 
    at the settlement.</LI>
  <LI><B>part-package:</B> A resupply mission may provide packages of parts in addition to listing each part separately.  Each part-package
    element must have a "name" attribute that matches a part package defined in the part packages configuration 
    (see <A HREF="conf_part_packages.html">conf/part_packages.xml</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number of part packages provided.</LI>
  <LI><B>resupply:</B> The resupply element is a list of resupply missions scheduled for this settlement template.  This element is optional
    and its absence means that the settlement template has no scheduled resupplies.  Each "resupply-mission" element must have a name that 
    matches a resupply mission name in the "resupply-list" below.  The "arrival-time" is the number of Sols (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) from the beginning of the simulation until the resupply mission is scheduled to 
    arrive.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "initial-settlement-list" is a list of settlements in the simulation.</P>
<P>Each "settlement" element has a "name" and a "template" attribute, as well as a "location" element.  The "name" attribute is either a
  unique name for the settlement, or "random", indicating that the name will be randomly selected from the "settlement-name-list" below.
  The "template" attribute must match a settlement template name (see above).</P>
<P>The "location" element is the longitude and latitude of the settlement.  The "longitude" and "latitude" attributes must have the location 
  degrees followed by the direction ("E" or "W" for longitude and "N" or "S" for latitude).  Alternatively they can have a value of "random", 
  indicating a random longitude or latitude.</P>
<P>The "settlement-name-list" is a list of settlement names that can be selected from for random settlement names.  Each "settlement-name"
  element must have a unique value and must not match a name of a settlement in the "initial-settlement-list".</P>
