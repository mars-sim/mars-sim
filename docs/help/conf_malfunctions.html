<H3>Updated for version 2.83</H3>
<H3>malfunctions.xml</H3>
<BR>
<P>The malfunctions.xml configuration file contains configuration for malfunctions that can occur in buildings, 
  vehicles and equipment.  New malfunctions can be added and existing ones edited.</P>
<P>A "malfunction" element has a unique "name" attribute.  It also has the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>severity:</B> The severity of the malfunction as an integer value between 1 and 100 (100 being most-severe).
    This is used to determine the order that people will attempt to fix multiple malfunctions.  This element is required
    for all malfunctions.</LI>
  <LI><B>probability:</B> The probability weight of the malfunction happening as a decimal value between 1.0 and 100.0
    (100.0 being most probable).  This is its probability relative to other possible malfunctions for an entity.  This
    element is required for all malfunctions.</LI>
  <LI><B>repair-time:</B> The normal repair time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required 
    to fix the malfunction. This element is optional and its absence means the malfunction doesn't need normal repairs.</LI>
  <LI><B>emergency-repair-time:</B> The emergency repair time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) 
    required to fix the malfunction. This element is optional and its absence means the malfunction doesn't need emergency 
    repairs.</LI>
  <LI><B>eva-repair-time:</B> The EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) repair time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required 
    to fix the malfunction. This element is optional and its absence means the malfunction doesn't need EVA repairs.</LI>
  <LI><B>entity-list:</B> This is a list of entities that are susceptible to this malfunction.  The malfunction must have at least
    one entity in the list.  The following entities are supported:<BR>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Vehicle:</B> Any vehicle.</LI>
      <LI><B>Rover:</B> A pressurized, long-range, all-terrain, ground vehicle that carries a crew.</LI>
      <LI><B>EVA Suit:</B> An Extra Vehicular Activity suit.</LI>
      <LI><B>Building:</B> This represents any building, regardless of its functions.</LI>
      <LI><B>Life Support:</B> A building with the "life-support" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Living Accommodations:</B> A building that has the "living-accommodations" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Research:</B> A building that has the "research" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Communication:</B> A building that has the "communication" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>EVA:</B> A building that has the "EVA" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Recreation:</B> A building that has the "recreation" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Dining:</B> A building that has the "dining" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Cooking:</B> A building that has the "cooking" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Exercise:</B> A building that has the "exercise" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Resource Processing:</B> A building that has the "resource-processing" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Storage:</B> A building that has the "storage" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Power Generation:</B> A building that has the "power-generation" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Medical Care:</B> A building that has the "medical-care" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Farming:</B> A building that has the "farming" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Ground Vehicle Maintenance:</B> A building that has the "ground-vehicle-maintenance" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
      <LI><B>Manufacture:</B> A building that has the "manufacture" function (see <A HREF="conf_buildings.html">buildings.xml</A>).</LI>
    </UL>
    Basically any building function is supported as a malfunctionable entity, only replace the hyphens in the function name with spaces.
    As we add more vehicles, equipment and building functions, they well be supported malfunctionable entities as well. </LI>
  <LI><B>effects-list:</B> A list of effects that this malfunction will produce.  The "effect" element has a "type" attribute that can have 
    the value of either "resource" or "life support".<BR>
    Resource effects mean that the malfunction is causing a reduction of a resource in the entity's inventory.  Any valid resource can be 
    used for the "name" attribute (see <A HREF="conf_resources.html">"conf/resources.txt"</A>).  The "change-rate" attribute is the amount 
    the resource changes (kg) per millisol (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>).<BR>
    Life support effects mean that the malfunction is changing the life support system in the entity.  The "name" attribute can be any of the 
    following: "Oxygen", "Water", "Temperature" or "Air Pressure".  Oxygen and water affect the rate that people can consume those resources 
    from the life support system.  Temperature affects the temperature of the life support system and is in degrees of Celsius per millisol.
    Air pressure affects the air pressure of the life support system and is in Atm per millisol.</LI>
  <LI><B>medical-complaint-list:</B> A list of possible medical problems that can be directly caused by this malfunction (see <A HREF="conf_medical.html">medical.xml</A>).  The "medical-complaint" element has a name that must match a medical complaint
    in the medical.xml configuration file.  The "probability" attribute is the percentage chance that any person directly affected by the 
    malfunction will get this medical complaint.  It is possible a person can get multiple medical complaints from one malfunction.</LI>
