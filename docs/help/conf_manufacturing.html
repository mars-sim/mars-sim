<P>The manufacturing.xml configuration file contains configuration for manufacturing processes that can be performed by 
  settlers in manufacturing buildings.  Manufacturing processes can be added, edited, or deleted.</P>
<P>A "malfunction" element has the following attributes: "name", "tech", "skill", "work-time", and "process-time".  The 
  "name" attribute has to be a unique name for the process.  The "tech" attribute is the minimum manufacturing building tech 
  level required for the process.  The "skill" attribute is the minimum materials science skill required for a settler to
  start or work on the process.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required to complete the process.  The "process-time" attribute is the total
  amount of time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required for the process to be completed.</P>
<P>The "malfunction" element has the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>inputs:</B> This is a list of input materials required for the process.  The inputs element is required, but there
    can be zero to many child elements of the following types:
    <UL>
      <LI><B>resource:</B> The resource element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">Resources</A>).  The "amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the 
        resource (kilograms) needed.</LI>
      <LI><B>part:</B> The part element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file 
        (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">"conf/parts.xml"</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI><B>outputs:</B> This is a list of output materials produced by the process.  The outputs element is required, but there
    can be zero to many child elements of the following types:
    <UL>
      <LI><B>resource:</B> The resource element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">Resources</A>).  The "amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the 
        resource (kilograms) produced.</LI>
      <LI><B>part:</B> The part element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file 
        (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">"conf/parts.xml"</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number of parts produced.</LI>
      <LI><B>equipment:</B> The equipment element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a supported type of equipment
        in the simulation (as of version 2.84, currently supported equipment are: "bag", "gas canister", "barrel", 
        "specimen container", and "eva suit".  The "number" attribute is the number of equipment produced.</LI>
      <LI><B>vehicle:</B> The vehicle element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the 
        conf/vehicles.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">"conf/vehicles.xml"</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number 
        of vehicles produced.</LI>
