<H2>buildings.xml</H2>
<P>The buildings.xml configuration file contains configuration for settlement buildings.  Buildings can be edited
  and new types of buildings can be defined here.</P>
<P>Each building is defined within "building" tags and must have a unique "name" attribute.</P>
<P>The "power-required" tag is required and describes the the buildings power requirements.  The "base-power" attribute
  is the base-line power (kW) required by the building when it is fully powered, not including the additional power required 
  for specific activities (such as life support).  The "base-power-down-power" attribute is the base-line power (kW) required by
  the building when it is powered down.</P>
<P>Each building has a list of functions that the building is capable of performing.  The "functions" tag is required, but it
  may be empty if the building performs no functions.  A building can have any of the possible functions, but each function may
  only be listed in the "functions" tag once.</P>
<P>Here is a list of possible building functions and their details.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>life-support:</B> This function indicates that the building is inhabitable by people.  The "capacity" attribute is the number
    of people the building is designed to accommodate.  Additional people can inhabit the building, but it will be overcrowded.  The
    "power-required" attribute is the additional power (kW) required for life support to function.</LI>
  <LI><B>living-accommodations:</B> This function indicates that the building has sleeping quarters.  The "beds" attribute is the number
    of sleeping quarters the building has.</LI>
  <LI><B>research:</B> This function indicates that the building has a research laboratory.  The "tech-level" attribute is the technology
    level of the lab.  Tech levels are described in the Tech Levels file.  The "capacity" attribute is the number of researchers
    who can use the lab at the same time.  A lab has one or more "research-speciality" elements that describe the sciences it supports.
    Sciences that currently can be supported by labs are "Areology", "Botany" and "Medicine".</LI>
  <LI><B>communication:</B> This function indicates that the building has radio/satellite communication equipment to communicate with 
    rovers, other settlements and Earth.  (note: This functionality isn't fully implemented in the simulation yet but is here as a 
    placeholder.)</LI>
  <LI><B>EVA:</B> This function indicates that the building has EVA (Extra Vehicle Activity) facilities, including an EVA suit storage area 
    and an airlock.  The "airlock-capacity" attribute is the number of people who can use the airlock at the same time. </LI>
  <LI><B>recreation:</B> This function indicates that the building has recreation facilities such as movies, games, music, etc. that let
    people relax and de-stress.</LI>
  <LI><B>dining:</B> This function indicates that the building has facilities for eating meals.</LI>
  <LI><B>cooking:</B> This function indicates that the building has facilities for cooking meals.  The "capacity" attribute is the number
    of cooks who can use the facility at a time.</LI>
  <LI><B>exercise:</B> This function indicates that the building has exercise equipment.  The "capacity" attribute is the number of people
    who can use the exercise equipment at once.</LI>
  <LI><B>resource-processing:</B> This function indicates that the building has equipment capable of processing resources.  The 
    "power-down-level" attribute is the proportional efficiency of resource processes when the building is in power-down mode.  Each process
    defined must have a unique name (for this building).  It can have one or several "input" and "output" elements that represent resources
    being consumed or produced by the process.  Resources can be any of the types defined in Resources.  The rate of an input
    or output resource in a process is the amount of the resource (kg) consumed/produced per millisol (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>).  The "ambient"
    attribute for input resources means that the resource is drawn in from outside the building (such as CO2 from the air outside) and for 
    output resources it means that the resource is discarded outside the building.</LI>
  <LI><B>storage:</B> This function indicates that the building is capable of storing certain resources.  See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">Resources</A> for 
    a list of all resources.  The "resource-storage" element shows the buildings capacity (kg) to store a particular resource.  The 
    "resource-initial" is the amount (kg) of a particular resource that the building starts with in storage.</LI>
  <LI><B>power-generation:</B> This function indicates that the building is capable of producing power.  The building can have multiple
    power sources.  Each "power-source" has a type and power (kW) attribute.  Current power source types supported in the simulation are
    "Standard Power Source" that has consistent power generation and "Solar Power Source" that only generates power when sunlight is 
    available.</LI>
  <LI><B>medical-care:</B> This function indicates that the building has a medical treatment facility.  The "tech-level" attribute is
    the treatment technology of the building (see <A HREF="conf_tech_level.html">Tech Levels</A>).  The "beds" attribute is 
    the number of people who can be treated in this building at once.</LI>
  <LI><B>farming:</B> This function indicates that the building is capable of growing crops.  The "crops" attribute is the number of crops
    that can be grown at a time in the building.  The "power-sustaining-crops" attribute is the power (kW) required to sustain each 
    growing crop.  The "growing-area" is the total surface area (square meters) for growing crops.</LI>
  <LI><B>ground-vehicle-maintenance:</B> This function indicates that the building has garage facilities for a ground vehicle.  This allows 
    a vehicle to be maintained without requiring an EVA (extra vehicle activity) to do so.  The "capacity" attribute is the mass (kg) of 
    vehicles that can be contained in the building at once.</LI>
  <LI><B>manufacture:</B> This function indicates that the building has facilities for manufacturing.  This allows people to perform
    manufacturing processes.  The "tech-level" attribute is the manufacturing technology capability of the building (see <A HREF="conf_tech_level.html">Tech Levels</A>).  The "concurrent-processes" attribute is the number of manufacturing processes
    that can be performed in the building at once.</LI>
