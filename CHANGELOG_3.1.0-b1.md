   prevent from fully restore credit/debit history between settlement and
   existing relationship between settlers.

### IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Refactored the meteorite impact calculation in MeteoriteImpactImpl.java and completed Part I and II below. (Part III still in-work).

Note: any observable impact will increase the stress level of the settlers on that building if his/her natural attribute of courage and emotional stability are not high enough.

Part I : Calculate the probability of impact per square meter per sol on the settlement, assuming the meteorite has an average impact velocity of 1km/s, critical diameter of .0016 cm and average density of 1 g/cm^3, per NASA study.

Part II: Calculate how far the incoming meteorite may penetrate the wall of a building

Part III: Implement equations of the probability distribution of different sizes of the meteorites. This no longer assumes the size and impact speed of the meteorites are homogeneous as in Part I and II.
