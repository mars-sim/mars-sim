<H2>Tutorial - Step 1: Introduction</H2>
<P>Welcome to the in-simulation tutorial of Mars Simulation Project.</P>
<P>Through these steps you will become familiar with the basic tools and viewers and learn how to overview and interact with the simulation. Expect it to take around 10 minutes.</P>
<P>The tutorial is supplemented by a more section-oriented guide, also accessible from the Help menu.</P>
<P>You can close this tutorial window at any time.</P>
<P>When you opened Mars Simulation Project for the first time, you were likely presented with two things that might seem confusing. First you were told that the 'default simulation did not load', and second you were asked to create a new simulation. Assuming you just clicked 'Create New Simulation' on the latter, you should now have been taken to the main simulation window, which has 'Mars Simulation Project' and a version number in its title.</P>
