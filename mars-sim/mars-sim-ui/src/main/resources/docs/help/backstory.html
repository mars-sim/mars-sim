<H2>Backstory</H2>
<P><TT>It’s the year 2043. Humanity has undertaken a massive international effort to explore and colonize Mars. Functional colonies are in place, and the settlers are hard at work making a society work in this new world, on this new continent.</TT></P>
<P><TT>Mars is a hostile environment, but you have skilled professionals at your disposal.
Tending greenhouses, making scientific studies, driving rovers....and sometimes recovering from burns or anxiety attacks…</TT></P>
<P><TT>Mars Simulation Project is more of a social what-if experiment than a classic game with a linear storyline or a set of rigidly defined goals. Of course you’ll want the settlers to survive, but there are no badges or awards other than the joy of progressing with the exploration and colonization of Mars.</TT></P>
<P><TT>You'll find great depth in the settlements, the interactions and the Martian soil....</TT><P>
