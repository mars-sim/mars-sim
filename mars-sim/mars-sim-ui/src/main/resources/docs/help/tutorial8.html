<H2>Tutorial - Step 8: Mission Tool</H2>
<P>The Mission Tool is where you see all the ongoing missions the inhabitants are on. Most of these are created and completed by MSP itself, but you can create new ones, modify existing ones or delete them downright. If you click the 'Navpoints' tab, a map shows you where the mission is happening or going to happen.</P>
