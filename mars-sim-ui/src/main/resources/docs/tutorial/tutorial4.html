<H2>Tutorial - Step 4: Mars Navigator Tool</H2>
<P>The Mars Navigator tool is basically a constantly updating overview map of Mars and your activities on the surface. You can use the arrows below the minimap to move the view around and update the detailed map view by clicking the "Center Map" button. <B>Try this now until you get the feeling.</B></P>
<P>You can also click on the various bases and rovers to see detailed information on them. When you do this, a unit window (remember step 2?) will display all kinds of information on the base or rover. In the window you can click on the tabs to select different topics concerning the unit.</P>
