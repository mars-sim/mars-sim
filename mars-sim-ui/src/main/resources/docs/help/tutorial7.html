<H2>Tutorial - Step 7: Monitor Tool</H2>
<P>The Monitor Tool shows a large matrix of groups: people, vehicles, settlements, missions, events that have happened, and goods for trade. You switch between these using the tabs. You can also use the buttons in the window's own toolbar to alter the view type - for example to a pie chart - using the corresponding button.</P>
