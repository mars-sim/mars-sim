<P>In the <A HREF="resupplytool.html">Resupply Tool</A>, you can create new resupply missions and 
edit the existing ones. </P>

<P>A resupply mission from Earth is a absolute necessity for replenishing and delivering certain equipment, parts or buildings that 
cannot be manufactured or 3-D printed. </P>

<P>There are five categories of Supply Items : Building, Equipment, Part, Resource, and Vehicle </P>

<P>On each resupply mission, you may decide the Destination, the Arrival Date or the # of Sols Until Arrival, 
the # of immigrants, and the quantity / amount (kg) of the Supply Items. </P>
