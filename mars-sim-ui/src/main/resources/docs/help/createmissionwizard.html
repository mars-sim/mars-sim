<H2>Create Mission Wizard</H2>
<P>The create new mission wizard allows you to create new missions.</P>
<P><B>First Panel</B></P>
<P>The first panel allows you to select the type of mission from the following options:</P>
<UL>

  <LI>Exploration - A rover mission to travel to and explore one or more sites and collect rock samples.</LI>
  <LI>Ice Prospecting - A rover mission to travel to a site and collect permafrost ice.</LI>
  <LI>Regolith Prospecting - A rover mission to travel to a site and collect mineral-rich regolith.</LI>
  <LI>Areology Study Field Mission - A rover mission to study a field site for areology research on a specific scientific study.</LI>
  <LI>Biology Study Field Mission - A rover mission to study a field site for biology research on a specific scientific study.</LI>
  <LI>Rescue/Salvage Vehicle - A rover mission to rescue or salvage a vehicle with its emergency beacon activated.</LI>
  <LI>Trade - A rover mission to travel to a nearby settlement and trade goods.</LI>
  <LI>Mining - A rover mission to mine at a nearby explored site.</LI>
  <LI>Building Construction - A mission to construct a building stage.</LI>
  <LI>Building Salvage - A mission to salvage a building stage.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The mission description defaults to the selected mission type, but can be edited by you.</P>
<P><B>Select Starting Settlement Panel</B></P>
<P>The select starting settlement panel allows you to select a starting settlement for the mission from a list of all the 
  settlements in the simulation.  Settlement rows with one or more red cells cannot be selected as starting settlements.</P>
<P><B>Select Rover Panel</B></P>
<P>The select rover panel allows you to select a rover for the mission from a list of rovers at the starting 
  settlement.  Rover rows with one or more red cells cannot be selected for the mission.</P>
<P><B>Select Members Panel</B></P>
<P>The select members panel allows you to select a group of members participating in the mission from a list of 
  people at the starting settlement.</P>
<P>One or more people can be selected from the Available People list and added to the
  Mission Members list by clicking the Add Members button.  Any people rows in the Available People list with red cells
  cannot be added to the mission.</P>
<P>Remaining rover capacity is displayed above the Mission Members list.  This capacity limits the number of available people
  who can be added to the mission.</P>
<P>One or more people in the Mission Members can be selected and removed as members by clicking the Remove Members button.</P>
<P><B>Select Destination Settlement Panel</B></P>
<P>The select destination settlement panel is the final panel when creating a Travel to Settlement mission or a Trade mission.  
  It allows you to select a destination settlement for the mission.</P>
<P>You can select a destination settlement from the list of settlements that are ordered by distance from the mission's 
  starting settlement.  Settlement rows with red cells cannot be selected as destination settlements.</P>
<P>If no settlements are selectable as a destination, you may wish to go back and select if different starting settlement
  or a mission rover with greater range.</P>
<P><B>Choose The Exploration Sites Panel</B></P>
<P>The choose exploration sites panel is the final panel when creating an Exploration mission.  It allows you to choose one
  or more exploration sites for the mission.</P>
<P>You can click on the blue navpoint flag at an exploration site and drag it to move the location of the site.  A green ellipse
  shows the range boundary of where the navpoint can be dragged.</P>
<P>The Add Site button will add a new exploration site to the mission at a default location.  The new site will be added to the list of
  exploration sites and a blue navpoint flag will be added to the map.</P>
<P>Additional exploration sites can be removed from the exploration site list with the Remove button.</P>
<P>Mineral concentrations are displayed as colored patches on the map.  The mineral legend below the map shows what color represents 
which mineral.</P>
<P><B>Choose Prospecting Sites Panel</B></P>
<P>The choose prospecting sites panel is the final panel when creating an Ice Prospecting mission or a Regolith Prospecting mission.  
  It allows you to choose an ice prospecting site for the mission.</P>
<P>An ice prospecting site is created at a default location.  You can click on the blue navpoint flag and drag it to move the location
  of the site.  A green circle shows the range boundary of where the navpoint can be dragged.</P>
<P><B>Select Rover to Rescue/Salvage Panel</B></P>
<P>The select rover to rescue/salvage panel is the final panel when creating a Rescue/Salvage Vehicle mission.  It allows you
  to select a rover to be rescued/salvaged for the mission.</P>
<P>You can select the rover from the list of rovers in the simulation that have their emergency beacons activated.  Rover rows with
  red cells cannot be selected.</P>
<P>If there are no rescue/salvage rovers available, you may wish to go back and select a different starting settlement or a mission 
  rover with greater range.  If there are no rescue/salvage rovers at all in the simulation, you may wish to end a nearby mission in
  the <A HREF="missiontool.html">Mission Tool</a> so that it is rescuable.</P>
<P><B>Select Good Amounts to be Sold</B></P>
<P>The select goods to sell panel lets you determine what trade goods to sell to the destination settlement.</P>
<P>You can select the trade good from the list of available goods on the left, type the number of goods in the center text field, and click
  the right button to add a number of goods to the sell list.  You can also select a trade good from the sell list to remove a number of them
  from the sell list.</P>
<P>Red text will display at the bottom of the panel if there is an error in the trade goods you selected.</P>
<P><B>Select Good Amounts to be Bought</B></P>
<P>The select goods to buy panel lets you determine what trade goods to buy from the destination settlement.</P>

starting settlement to mine.</P>
<P>You can select one of the explored sites (marked by yellow flags) within the rover's range (indicated by the green circle).  When an 
explored site is selected, information about the site is displayed on the right, including its coordinate location and the estimated
mineral concentrations at the site.</P>
<P>Mineral concentrations are displayed as colored patches on the map.  The mineral legend below the map shows what color represents 
which mineral.</P>

<P><B>Select a Scientific Study</B></P>
<P>The select a scientific study panel allows the user to select a scientific study for a research mission from a list of all the 
ongoing studies in the simulation.  Studies need to be in the research phase and have a researcher in the specified scientific field of the mission

<P><B>Choose a Field Research Site</B></P>
<P>The choose field research site panel is the final panel when creating an areology or biology field research mission.  It allows the user to choose 
a field research site for the mission.</P>
