<H2>construction.xml</H2>
<P>The construction.xml configuration file contains configuration for building construction stages.  Construction stages
can be added, edited, or deleted.</P>
<P>The "foundation-list" element contains multiple "foundation" elements that represent a foundation construction stage.
A "foundation" element contains the following attributes: "name", "work-time", and "skill-required".  The "name" attribute
has to be a unique name for the stage.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols)
(See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required to complete the foundation construction.  The "skill-required"
attribute is the minimum construction skill required for an architect to start the foundation construction mission.</P>
<P>The "foundation" element contains the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> Each "resource" element represents a type of resource needed to construct the foundation.  The "resource" 
element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).  The 
"amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>part:</B> Each "part" element represents a type of part needed to construct the foundation.  The "part" element has a 
"name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  
The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>vehicle:</B> Each "vehicle" element represents a construction vehicle needed to construct the foundation.  The "vehicle" 
element has a "type" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the conf/vehicles.xml file (See 
<A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>).<BR><BR>
The "vehicle" element can contain a list of "attachment-part" child elements that represents attachment parts needed by
the vehicle.  Each "attachment-part" element as a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml 
file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "frame-list" element contains multiple "frame" elements that represent a frame construction stage.
A "frame" element contains the following attributes: "name", "work-time", and "skill-required".  The "name" attribute
has to be a unique name for the stage.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols)
(See <A HREF="conf_time.html">Time</A>) required to complete the frame construction.  The "skill-required"
attribute is the minimum construction skill required for an architect to start the frame construction mission.</P>
<P>The "frame" element contains the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> Each "resource" element represents a type of resource needed to construct the frame.  The "resource" 
element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).  The 
"amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>part:</B> Each "part" element represents a type of part needed to construct the frame.  The "part" element has a 
"name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  
The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>vehicle:</B> Each "vehicle" element represents a construction vehicle needed to construct the frame.  The "vehicle" 
element has a "type" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the conf/vehicles.xml file (See 
<A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>).<BR><BR>
The "vehicle" element can contain a list of "attachment-part" child elements that represents attachment parts needed by
the vehicle.  Each "attachment-part" element as a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml 
file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "building-list" element contains multiple "building" elements that represent a building construction stage.
A "building" element contains the following attributes: "name", "work-time", and "skill-required".  The "name" attribute
has to be a unique name for the stage.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols)
(See <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required to complete the building construction.  The "skill-required"
attribute is the minimum construction skill required for an architect to start the building construction mission.</P>
<P>The "building" element contains the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> Each "resource" element represents a type of resource needed to construct the building.  The "resource" 
element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See <A HREF="conf_resources.html">resources.xml</A>).  The 
"amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>part:</B> Each "part" element represents a type of part needed to construct the building.  The "part" element has a 
"name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).  
The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
<LI><B>vehicle:</B> Each "vehicle" element represents a construction vehicle needed to construct the building.  The "vehicle" 
element has a "type" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the conf/vehicles.xml file (See 
<A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">vehicles.xml</A>).<BR><BR>
The "vehicle" element can contain a list of "attachment-part" child elements that represents attachment parts needed by
the vehicle.  Each "attachment-part" element as a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml 
file (See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">parts.xml</A>).</LI>
