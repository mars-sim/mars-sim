<H2>Configuration Editor</H2>
<P>The Configuration Editor allows you to configure what type of initial settlements you would like to start with in a new simulation you are going to create.</P>
<P>It displays a table of settlements soon to be created in the new simulation.  The table is initially populated with a default set of settlements
and allows users to customize the following characteristics of a settlement :
<OL>
  <li>Settlement Name</li>
  <li>Settlement Template</li>
  <li>Population</li>
  <li># of Bot</li>
  <li>Sponsoring Agency</li>
  <li>Latitude</li>
  <li>Longitude</li>
</OL>
 </P>

<P>If a field is changed to an invalid value, a red error message appears below the table and
the 'Start' button will be disabled until it is fixed.</P>

<P>The 'Add' button will add a new settlement with a random configuration to the table.</P>
<P>The 'Remove' button will remove any selected settlements from the table.</P>
<P>The 'Undo' button will clear all user changes and reset the table to holding only the two default settlements.</P>
<P>The 'Start' button will close the dialog, create and start a new simulation with the configured settlements.</P>
<P>The 'Crew Editor' button allows you to edit the alpha crew roster.</P>

<H2>Crew Editor</H2>
<P>The Alpha Crew Editor presents the user a degree of freedom in customizing the profile of 4 settlers. Their characteristics
were pre-configured in people.xml. You may choose their common settlement destination and alter the followings :
<OL>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Gender</li>
  <li>Job</li>
  <li>Sponsor</li>
  <li>Country</li>
  <li>MBTI Personality</li>
