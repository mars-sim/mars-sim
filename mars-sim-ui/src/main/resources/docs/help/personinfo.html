<H2>Person Information Window</H2>
<P>The person info window displays information about an individual person. A number of tab panels are available for viewing particular 
information.</P>

Mars Navigator tool centered on the person's location. The next button to the right displays the settlement or vehicle the person is 
currently located within. If the person is outside, no button is displayed.</P>
<P>The person's name is displayed at the top right of the window.</P>
<P><B>Inventory -</B> The inventory tab panel displays information about the resources and equipment the person is carrying.</P>

associated with the task. When the experience in a skill passes a threshold, the skill level increases. The threshold for each skill 
doubles for each successive skill level, making it more difficult to reach higher levels.</P>
<P><B>Natural Attributes -</B> The attributes tab panel shows the person's natural attributes.</P>
<P>Attributes are randomly determined and effect how well a person performs certain tasks.</P>
