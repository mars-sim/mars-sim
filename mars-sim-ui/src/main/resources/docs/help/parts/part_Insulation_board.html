<h2>Part : "Insulation board"</h2>
</p><br/>1. Mass Per Unit : 1.0kg<br/><br/>
2. Description :<p><ul><li>
Extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene insulation (EPS) contain millions of 
		air pockets trapped within the foam. Because the polystyrene itself is also highly resistant to heat, 
		the result is a great thermal insulator which can give excellent R-ratings. In addition to this, 
		XPS is often lined with aluminium foil </li></ul></p><br/>
