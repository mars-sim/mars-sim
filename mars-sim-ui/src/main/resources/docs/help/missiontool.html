<H2>Mission Tool</H2>
<P>The Mission tool displays information about current missions and allows you to create, modify and delete missions.</P>
<P>The left mission list shows all current missions in the simulation.  
You can select a mission and its information will be displayed in the right panel.</P>
<P>The Info tab panel shows text information about the selected mission.</P>
<P>The top box shows the mission description, type, and current phase.</P>
<P>The middle box shows the current number of mission members, as well as the minimum and maximum allowed for the mission. There's a list of the names of mission members and the tasks they're currently performing. If you click on a member in the list, the person's info window will open.</P>
<P>The bottom box shows a button with the name of the vehicle used in the mission.  If you click on the button, the vehicle info window will open. To the left of the vehicle button is the center map button. If you click on it, it will display the Mars navigator tool with the map centered on the vehicle. Below that the vehicle's current status and speed are displayed as well as the distance to the next navpoint as well as the total distance traveled.</P>
<P>Some types of missions will display additional information when selected.</P>
<P>The mining mission displays the a button for the light utility vehicle used for excavation on the mission.  It displays a table showing the estimated  minerals at the mining site, and a table showing the minerals that have been collected during the mission.</P>
<P>The trade mission displays tables showing the goods that are taken to be sold to the trading settlement, the goods that trader hopes to buy, and the goods that are actually bought from the trading settlement once the trade is negotiated.</P>
<P>The estimated trade profit for the starting settlement, as well as its actual negotiated trade profit, are displayed above the relevant tables in units of value points.</P>
<P>The construction mission displays the current construction stage with a progress bar showing its progress towards completion.</P>
<P>The Navpoint tab panel shows information about the mission's navpoint destinations.</P>
<P>The mission navpoints are marked by blue flags on the map. Directional arrow buttons on the edges of the map will recenter the map to their respective direction.  Below the map is a list of the mission's navpoints. If a mission on the list is selected, the map is recentered on that navpoint.</P>

<P>The buttons at the bottom of the mission tool:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Create New Mission - This button will pause the simulation and open the <A HREF="createmissionwizard.html">create new mission wizard</A>.</LI>
  <LI>Modify Mission - This button will pause the simulation and open the edit mission dialog (see below) for the selected mission.</LI>
  <LI>End Mission - This button will end the selected mission.  If the mission is currently outside a settlement, the vehicle's emergency
    beacon will be turned on.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The Edit Mission dialog allows you to edit a current mission.</P>
<P>The mission description text can be edited at the top.</P>
<P>The action dropdown has one or more of the following actions that can be taken, based on the mission's current situation:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>None - No action will be taken (default).</LI>
  <LI>End EVA and Continue to Next Site - The mission will end the current extra vehicular activity and, once all the mission members are back onboard the rover, continue on to the next navpoint site.</LI>
  <LI>Return to Home Settlement and End Mission - The mission will return back to its home settlement and disembark.</LI>
  <LI>Go to Nearest Settlement and End Mission - The mission will travel to the nearest settlement and disembark.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The members table lists all current mission members.</P>
<P>If there are people at the mission's current location who can be added as members, the Add Members button is enabled.  Pressing the Add Members button  will open a dialog listing available people to add to the mission. One or more can be selected from the list and added to the mission.</P>
<P>The Remove Members button will remove any members selected in the members list from the mission. If the mission is currently at a settlement, the removed members will remain at the settlement. If the mission is currently away from a settlement, the removed members will remain in the rover, but will not be a part of the mission. Should all mission members get removed, the mission will end and the rover emergency beacon will be turned on if the mission is away from a settlement.</P>
<P>The Modify button at the bottom of the Edit Mission dialog will close the dialog, commit any changes made to the mission, and unpause the simulation.</P>
<P>The Cancel button at the bottom of the Edit Mission dialog will close the dialog, not make any changes to the mission, and unpause the simulation.</P>
