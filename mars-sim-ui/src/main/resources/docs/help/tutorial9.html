<H2>Tutorial - Step 9: Settlement Map Tool</H2>
<P>The Settlement Map View is where you really zoom in on a particular settlement, as if you were hovering over it - and seeing through the buildings with x-ray vision. You can see all the various buildings complete with descriptions, and even see which people are in each building or outside.</P>
<P>The tools at the top will let you switch to another settlement, zoom and rotate the map (you can also use your mouse wheel for zooming) and choose whether you want the labels displayed or not.</P>
