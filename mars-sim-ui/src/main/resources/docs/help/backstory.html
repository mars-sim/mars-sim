<H2>Backstory</H2>
<P>It is the year of 2028. Humanity has finally broken new ground in reaching and settling Mars. 
It's a massive undertaking, sponsored and kick-started by numerous space agencies and space 
enterprises. Now new colonies are being sprouted up all over on this new continent, forming new
 human societies as we speak in this brave new world.</P>

<P>No two settlements will look the same. One settlement may start from a simple 
four-person Lander Hab with an EVA Airlock and a Inflatable Greenhouse. The other settlement may
start with a Lander Hab, an EVA Airlock and a Fishery. Down the road, each settlement will find 
her own destiny, endeavors to undertake, objectives to meet and an identity to embrace.  
There are also mining towns sprawling up whose sole purpose is to prospect minerals 
while there are bases that are evolved to house hundreds of people with specialized buildings
and more developed living areas. </P>

<P>Thankfully, settlers are by and large happy, skillful and resourceful. They are bringing their
unique life experiences as well as their areas of expertise to this new world. Some find their 
roles in tending greenhouses to feed the populace. Some manufacture useful products. Some prospect
for minerals. Some maintain vehicles and equipment. Some engage in scientific inquiries about the 
origin of life, etc.</P>

<P>That said, some prefer to venture out on rover missions to study surrounding areas, to explore
 uncharted territories, to prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and to trade with their 
 neighboring settlements.</P>

<P>Mars's magnificent landscape is an untamed beauty but it can be hostile to the unsuspected. 
Has it always been a big, lifeless rock? Its past ecosystem, if any, awaits humanity's further 
investigations. </P>

<P>Reality is far from perfect, settlers still come face-to-face with meteorite impacts, 
radiation sickness, equipment malfunctions, accidents, illnesses, injuries, and even death. 
Sometimes survival depends on how well they work together in harmony, how they use their attributes,
instincts, and skills, and how well they balance their individual vs. collective needs. </P>

<P>As settlers survive hardship and build up their settlements, they are rewarded with the pure
 joy of participating in this grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society 
 on another planetary surface.</P>

<P>Living and thriving on Mars is full of challenges and surprises for sure. There are no one
single recipe for success that one can follow. But at the end, it will worth the sum of all 
our efforts as we are becoming a multi-planetary species continuing our stories of living among 
the stars.</P>
