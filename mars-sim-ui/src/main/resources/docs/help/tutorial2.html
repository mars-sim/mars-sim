<hr>
<P>The Main Simulation Window is the overall window area upon which the player may query how the simulation is doing. </P>

<P>In window mode, you will see a row of icons right below title bar.</P>

<P>The desktop area hosts the content of any tools you may open. </P>

<P>At the start of a new simulation, it defaults to opening the Help Browser.</P> 

<P>If the Sandbox Mode is chosen, no other tools will be popped open. 
In this case, the Monitor Tool will the status of each settlement in the simulation.</P>
