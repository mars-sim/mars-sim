<h2>Resource : "Taenite" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ol><li>Taenite is a major constituent of iron meteorites. 
	 An alloy of iron and nickel, with nickel proportions of 20% up to 65%. The name is derived 
	 from the Greek meaning band or ribbon. In octahedrites it is found in bands interleaving 
	 with kamacite forming Widmanstätten patterns, whereas in ataxites it is the dominant 
	 constituent. In octahedrites a fine intermixture with kamacite can occur, which is 
	 called plessite. Taenite is one of four known Fe-Ni meteorite minerals: The others are 
	 kamacite, tetrataenite, and antitaenite.</li></ol></p><br/>
