<h2>Resource : "Granite" (Solid)	</h2>
<br/>1. Description :<br/>
<p><ol><li>The granitoid rocks on Mars may have formed when thick
	 sequences of basaltic rocks were metamorphosed by moderate heat and pressure and then 
	 partially melted. Observed the craters' central peaks, they must have been dredged up from 
	 depths by the force of the crater-making impact. http://themis.asu.edu/node/5395.</li></ol></p><br/>
