<H2>Tutorial - Step 4 : Mars Navigator Minimap</H2>
<hr>

<P>The <A HREF="navigator.html">Mars Navigator</a> comes with two parts: the Mars globe and the Detail Map. 
It provides constant updates of your activities on the surface of Mars. </P> 

<P>Simply use your mouse to drag around the area inside either the Mars globe or the detailed map to take you 
where you want to see. </P>  

<br>
<P>In the detailed map, you may see various names of settlements, landmarks, vehicles and trip marks. </P>

<P>There are a total of 8 data layers that you may toggle on/off on the detailed map. </P>

<P><i>Note : since the day/night tracking layer may consume a fair bit of processing power to 
obtain the correct data points for simulating the day/night coverage of Mars, 
users may consider un-checking it in order to lower the CPU usage. </i></P>

<br>

<P>Currently, there are 10 available minerals that settlers may be able to prospect and mine. </P>

<P>You may toggle on/off the appearance of each mineral on the detailed map. </P>

<P>To see the detail info of a base or a vehicle, hover over it until the crossmark appears. 
Then click on its overlaying label and its Unit Window will be opened in the Main tab.</P>
