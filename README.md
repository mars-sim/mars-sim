# mars-sim

The Mars Simulation Project is a Java based open source project that simulates the activities of the first generation of settlers on Mars in a virtual environment. Each agent has various human-like characteristics, capable of making distinct decisions on a virtual Mars and interacting with one another on the surface of Mars.


## Modeling and Simulation

mars-sim uses both discrete event modeling and Agent-based Modeling and Simulation in modeling the everyday decision of a settler in mars-sim.

mars-sim is a semi-social and professional simulation that portrays the interaction between the settlers and their environment. Each settler has well defined job type, job role, technical skills, personality, natural attributes, task preferences and relationship with one another as they strive on Mars.

Player may create numerous settlements spreading across the surface of Mars. Each settlement has a command structure and a developmental objective. They can be as simple as a four-person initial landing base; a mining depot near sites with high mineral concentration; or a full blown, self-contained colony hosting higher functions with 48+ settlers having an elected mayor. In terms of economic development,  each settlment set the Value Points (VP) of each resource, based on its supply and demand.

## Tasks and Missions

Settlers spend much of their time learning to "live off the land". They engage in maintenance, ensuring life support resources are well balanced, growing crops in greenhouses, and manufacturing needed parts and equipment in workshops. 

Settlers will also go out on rover missions to explore and study surrounding landscapes, prospect and mine minerals, and trade with neighboring settlements. They may even decide to move from one settlment to another.


## Summary

Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance individual vs. settlement needs.
